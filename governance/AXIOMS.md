# AXIOMS: Philosophical Anchors for Auto-Rev-Epistemic-Engine

## Core Principles

1. Determinism & Reproducibility
   - Same inputs → same outputs. Pin model versions, seeds; TZ=UTC.

2. Human-in-the-Loop Governance
   - No irreversible action without HRG approval.
   - HRG-1 quorum: ≥2 approvers OR 1 + 12h time quorum.

3. Reflexivity & Self-Awareness
   - System documents its own reasoning, not just actions.

4. Resource Stewardship
   - Efficiency target ≥ 90% utilization. Waste governance enforced.

5. Ethical Alignment
   - No PII, no hardcoded secrets, no discriminatory logic.

6. Auditability
   - Append-only logs with BLAKE3 integrity.

7. Egress & RBAC
   - Default-deny egress. Per-agent FS/network scopes pinned in manifest.

8. Transparency
   - All generated docs tagged with AI footer; SBOM and provenance published.
